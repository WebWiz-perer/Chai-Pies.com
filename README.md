Featuring warm, earthy tones and scenes that evoke cozy tea times and homemade treats, the visuals create an inviting atmosphere meant to foster feelings of comfort and relaxation. These earthy hues not only add warmth but also harmonize with the primary color palette, reinforcing the brand’s identity.

### Colour Scheme

The main colors used are Brown and Beige to give a warmth and natural touch to the website. The breakdown of colors is as follows:

## Dark Brown (#402e32):
 Found in borders, hover states, and background accents to add cohesiveness across elements and a rich, rustic feel.

These colors are supported by white and black for neutral contrast and clarity. The result is a warm, natural, and cohesive color scheme that feels both inviting ,sophisticated and effortlessly unified.

### Fonts

 ## Bugs Found and solved
 -When I first implemented my navigation bar, I was having lots of space on the left side and all the items of navigation bar were centered. I tried reducing the padding but nothing helped and after little resecrh into bootstrap and css, apllied flex to display and it was sorted.
 - When adding images, I was using absolute rather than relative path and was not able to see the error until I deployed my website. The error was not visible in preview as the pictures were loading. After going forth and back found out that it was due to absolute path being used.
 - I applied the images initially to the size that I downloaded. 
 - There were other minor hiccups in css but was sorted by adding media queries.
 - When dowloading images from source I selected small for the size and thought that would be enough but then lighthouse checks showed the sizes of images were resulting in low score and therefore compressed and changed the images to modern format i.e png and webp.
 - Initially, I didn't use Bootstrap for the images, which caused alignment issues with the content. Once I applied Bootstrap, however, the images displayed with a pleasantly aesthetic alignment.

 ## Unsolved Bugs
 
 - The background video on contact form doesnot really work as intended on safari. It works fine on edge, chrome and firefox. It actually is static when behind the form on safari and overshadows the form when played.

 - Also, the score on best practices contact page is 79 due to third party loading speed. 

## Future Scope

- Adding separate pages to each category in menu with detailed ingredients and pice list.

- Improving the display of services card in About us page on Ipad air and larger screens.

- Adding a page about Fusion Food Stories & Insights where we can Share articles, recipes, and stories that celebrate the cultural blending behind our cuisine, inspiring guests with the rich heritage of each flavor.
