These earthy hues not only add warmth but also harmonize with the primary color palette, reinforcing the brand’s identity.

## Bugs Found and solved
-When I first implemented my navigation bar, I was having lots of space on the left side and all the items of navigation bar were centered. I tried reducing the padding but nothing helped and after little resecrh into bootstrap and css, apllied flex to display and it was sorted.
- When adding images, I was using absolute rather than relative path and was not able to see the error until I deployed my website. The error was not visible in preview as the pictures were loading. After going forth and back found out that it was due to absolute path being used.
- I applied the images initially to the size that I downloaded. 
- There were other minor hiccups in css but was sorted by adding media queries.
